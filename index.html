    <h2 style="font-size: 2.0em; font-family: 'HP Simplified'; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">Interest for Development</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 1.0em; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif; line-height:1.4em;"> As a young girl, I was always fascinated by technology. As technology becomes a part of our daily lives, there are more opportunities for web designers and developers. As for me, I see myself as a web developer because development itself is like building a house for someone to live or a skyscraper for tourists. Within this website, I will tell you how I journey as a novice developer through trial and error.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2.0em; font-family: 'HP Simplified'; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">Challenges as an Developer</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.0em; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif; line-height:1.4em;">Web development can consider “challenging” to those who are new to such areas, and I was new but I feel that there was a good handle if you have a rhythm with the code. I did not have a lot of experience at first when I was introduced to development, I was introduced when I came into college to study I.T management and software development. At first, it is like riding a bike, but on a personal level, developing is a sort of challenge with a mix of creativity a blank web page is your canvas. Especially if it’s a complex web-based site where it can contain anything. It can be between a business information website or a huge social media-based website where users can share pictures or share stories.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2.0em; font-family: 'HP Simplified'; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">New Opportunities</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.0em; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif; line-height:1.4em;">Working and learning new skills is a new way to make a difference in my life as a web developer. Especially with technology increases each day, which allows me to learn and increase my ability so I can be better and becomes a part of this growth in our age. I am always willing to learn something new every day and help me to become a better developer. Also, I am always a team player when it comes to working projects which is a fun way to learn about each other and myself as well.</p>
